This repository presents practices about:
- Setup a blockchain.
- Develop Etherium smart contracts.
- Write tests for the developed Etherium smart contracts. 
- Develop a client-side website so people can actually use this application.

Users use an Internet browser to connect front-end application which is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then, instead of accessing a back-end server, the website talks directly to the blockchain which is where all the codes and data for the application lives. The DeFi application codes are contained in smart contracts written in solidity progrramming language which was a lot like JavaScript. These smart contracts are immutable which means the code can not change and all the data is stored in the public ledger which is also immutable. And, anytime new data is added to the blockchain, it will be permanent and publicly verifiable.
